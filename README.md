# responsive-website-with-some-images




i used many images because of the website which is an images website
some of them may be subjected to copyrights
so you may need to change those images with your own
you need to clone images folder also for my project to look good

and those images are a little high quality
if you want to decrease the loading speed of your website try to change the resolution or replace the image with your own
